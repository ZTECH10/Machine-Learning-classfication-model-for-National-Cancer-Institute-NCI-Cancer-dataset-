**Project Summary: Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial Analysis** 🩺📊

**Project Description:**
The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), aims to assess the risk of developing PLCO cancer. The screening phase concluded in 2006, but data collection continued until 2015. This mini-project focuses on a subset of the dataset with 216 patients, classified as ('C') cancer and ('N') No cancer, featuring 4000 features encompassing gene-related and blood-related information. 🧬💉

**Project Steps:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Remove duplicates 🗑️
   - Visualization 📊
   - Encoding the Output Data 📊
   - Checking if the dataset contains any NULL values 🧐
   - Taking care of outliers 📊🧐
   - Feature Scaling 📏

2. **Model Selection:**
   - PCA with SKLearn (Part A) 📊
   - PCA with SKLearn (Part B) 📊
   - ANN Classifier with first 10 PCs (Part C) 🧠
   - KNN 📊
   - SVM-RBE 📊
   - Naive Bayes 📊

3. **Model Training:**
   - Split data into training and testing sets 🧩
   - Train selected models on training data 🚀

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics 📊
   - Analyze confusion matrix 📉
   - Plotting the Learning Curve 📈

5. **Additional Analysis (if needed):**
   - Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization ⚙️
